Problem Statement of Tableau Project

Company Overview:
Atliq Hardware is a leading supplier of hardware peripherals, catering to a diverse range of clients including Normad Stores, Surge Stores, Excel Stores, and Electricalsara Stores. The company is headquartered in Delhi, India, with regional offices across various states. The sales operations are overseen by Bhavin Patel, the Sales Director, who manages the business from the head office.

Current Challenge:
Atliq Hardware has observed a decline in sales across its regions, which has posed a significant challenge for Bhavin Patel. He is struggling to pinpoint the areas of concern and track the reasons for the decline in sales effectively. To address this issue, Bhavin has collected data from regional managers and tasked the company's data analysts with deriving actionable insights from this data.

Key Questions:
1. Who are our top five customers?
2. Which are the two weakest regions in terms of declining sales?
3. What is our aggregate revenue over the last 365 days (year-to-date revenue)?

Purpose:
To uncover hidden sales insights to aid the sales team in decision-making and automate data gathering to reduce manual effort.

Stakeholders:
- Sales Director  
- Marketing Team  
- Customer Service Team  
- IT Team

End Result:
Develop an automated dashboard that provides quick and up-to-date sales insights, supporting data-driven decision-making.

Success Criteria:
1. Create a dashboard that provides sales order insights with the latest available data.
2. Enable the sales team to make better decisions, resulting in a 10% cost saving on total spending.
3. Eliminate manual data gathering by the sales analysts, saving 20% of their time to reinvest in value-added activities.

Technical Background:
The IT team at Atliq Hardware has developed a sales management software system, which stores data in a MySQL database. The data engineers perform ETL processes to transform and load the data. The data analysts then access this database to extract insights.
